# Time gaps between milestones in years
# Format: [p_zero, lower_bound, upper_bound]
times:
  "SC to SAR": [0.15, 1.5, 10]
  "SAR to SIAR": [0, 2, 250] # currently unused
  "SIAR to ASI": [0, 3, 500] # currently unused
  "ASI to WS": [0, 4, 1000] # currently unsused

# Speed multipliers at each milestone
speedups:
  SC: 5
  SAR: 25
  SIAR: 250
  ASI: 2000
  WS: 10000 # currently unused

# Projects/actors configuration
# Each project has a progress_rate that represents how much of a slowdown there is
# For example, 0.3 means progress goes at 30% of normal rate (3x slower)
projects:
  "Leading Lab": 1.0      # Normal speed (baseline)
  "Second Lab": 0.7       # 70% of normal speed
  "Third Lab": 0.5        # 50% of normal speed
  "Academic Project": 0.3 # 30% of normal speed

# Simulation parameters
simulation:
  n_sims: 50 # Should be 5000 for full simulation
