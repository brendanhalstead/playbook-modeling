# Projects/actors configuration
# Limitation: For now the initial software months behind can't be more than 24 months.
# initial_software_months_behind: How many months behind the leading lab the project's software efficiency starts.
# initial_hardware_multiple: The percentage of compute of the leading lab that the projects starts with.
# software_progress_rate: The progress rate of the project's software efficiency relative to the leading lab's if it were going full speed.
# Limitation: For now we intutively guesstimate how hardware affects the software progress rate rather than doing this programatically. The hardware multiple and software progress rate are correlated in the simuation.
# Limitation: We also assume that the software progress rate doesn't change over time, which likely isn't true e.g. the dynamics change as AI R&D gets more automated.
# Format: [p_zero, lower_bound, upper_bound, ceiling] for 80% confidence interval of lognormal distribution
